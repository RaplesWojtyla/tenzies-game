# Tenzies Game (React App)

This is a simple and interactive **Tenzies game** built with **React**. The game allows players to roll dice and try to get all the dice showing the same number. The objective is to hold the dice that match, and re-roll the others until all dice are the same.

## Features:
- **Interactive dice rolling**: Roll the dice and try to match all of them to the same value.
- **Hold functionality**: Click on a dice to hold its value, so it won't roll again.
- **Game reset**: Option to reset the game and start over when the player wins the game.
- **Winning state**: The game ends when all dice are held with the same value.
- **Roll counter**: Tracks the number of times the player has rolled the dice.

## Technologies:
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For logic and functionality.
- **CSS**: For styling the game components.

This project is a fun and simple implementation of the classic Tenzies dice game, allowing users to test their luck and try to match all dice values.

## React + Vite

This project provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
